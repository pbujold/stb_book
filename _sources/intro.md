# **Save the Bay x BE.Center Fertilizer Use Study**
---
## Study overview

Save the Bay collaborated with Rare’s Center for Behavior and the Environment to identify perceptions and behaviors related to lawn fertilizer use among residents in Aquidneck Island. We conducted primary research using interviews, and then developed a survey (n=48) to assess the underlying factors associated with lawn fertilizer use and perceptions of modifying these practices to positively impact the environment and improve water quality across the island. The results of this survey are found below.

### Goal
This research aims at deepening Save the Bay’s understanding of what behavioral factors may drive or influence residents of Aquidneck Island when it comes to promoting sustainable fertilizer usage. The findings from this study will be used to support current and ongoing Maidford River water quality restoration efforts, and to inform future water quality improvement efforts across Aquidneck Island, including advocacy efforts on the municipal level and island-wide communications. They will also be shared with organizations seeking to address fertilizer use and its impacts on Aquidneck Island water quality issues.

### Methodology
Using insights from the literature, our Save the Bay colleagues’ knowledge, as well as qualitative findings from the interviews, we designed a survey aimed at gauging the prevalence of behavior, beliefs, and preferences around fertilizer usage. 

The topics covered in the survey included socio-demographic characteristics of respondents, current lawn care and fertilizer practices, their knowledge of the impact of their fertilizer use, decision-making regarding fertilizer use, norms and social expectations of lawn care, and their perceptions of people who choose to reduce fertilizer usage. 

We also included rigid screener questions and a series of nested quality checks that would disqualify responses if they failed to pay attention or give thoughtful answers.The estimated time to complete the survey was 15 to 18 minutes. 

### Limitations
Out of 361 entries, only 48 respondents passed objectively easy attention checks. Response numbers are too low to be considered representative of the entire Aquidneck Island population. However, the data still provides relevant directional insights that can be used to inform the next steps of the intervention design.
